<h2>Carrer Goals</h2>
<main>
    <p>
        For now my carrer goal is to become a front end developer. I love creating and I know my work isnt the greatest right now but I want to learn to make
        myself the best I can be with creating.
        As for my dream job I dont have one for now. But honestly any company thats willing to take me in and help me grow to what I want to become 
        will hopefully become my dream job. I want to make enough to be able to support my family and make their childhood a little better than mine. 
        I promise my childhood wasnt depressing, my family just had a tighter budget.

    <p>I've created these over my time on this earth. I had a deep love for football since I saw my brothers first football game.
        Since I was in first grade I wanted to play football. Watching Ohio State every saturday with my brother made me want to play even more.
        Due to my family being relativly poor growing up we couldn't afford to pay for football fees.
        this game a lot of motivation to gain money for myself. Cutting lawns I was able to pay for footabll my 8th grade year and the rest was history.
        I played at Orem High and started varisty my senior year. 
        I ended up winning state all four years of high school but the last two years were more earned by my part. As for wrestling I did it freshman year.
        Freshman year was my first year wreslting and I ended up takng second in state. I know second is awesome but not winning state crushed my soul. But due to my 
        extreme weight loss during wrestling season of dropping almost 30 pounds my doctor and mother didnt let me to continue to wrestle as I could develop a eating disorder.

        I've always loved video games. Thats how me and my brother bonded growing up. My favorite games are Halo 2 and Destiny both tied for first place.
        I have so many fun and awesome memories with those games. I actually met my best friends due to destiny and im so happy for those friendships that still continue to this day.
        Right now im currently addicted to playing League of Legends. I'm a mid and top laner and my favorite champs are Zed and Yone.

    <p>
        Music is a great way for me to vibe and just relieve some stress that piles up in the day. Im a huge sucker for 90's rap so 2Pac is my favorite artist
        as typical as it is. I also love underground rap such as Ghostmane, $uicideboy$, Pouya, Rameriez and many  more. They aren't really family friendly so id
        have headphones in if you wanted to listen to them. Just a little tip
    </p>
    <p>
        Legos are a newer interest. Over quarantine I worked with my dad from 4am till 3pm at his concerete job and cutting lawns after. Due to me not being able to go out I found a hobby in legos.
        My favorite set is the lego Hogwarts set from harry potter. Its the 3rd largest set I believe and I loved every moment of building it.
